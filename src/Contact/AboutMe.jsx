            <p className='lead'>I learn HTML5, CSS3 Node.js and React with GammaIntelligence courses. I already learnt such frameworks as Bootstrap and SCSS. I chose this field because I like combining of programming and design in one speciality.
                And also Iâ€™m 4th year student of Ukrainian Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding, learning software development.
                For this time I learnt basis of C, C++ and Java languages. I also had experience of working with IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL and JavaFX. I created one project using Java and MySQL. I have worked with Windows, MacOS and a little with Linux Mint operating systems.
                P.S. I also good in understanding programming memes :)
