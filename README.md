## What EnergyToday app is?
_EnergyToday_ is an online application developed by student of a front-end course _Gamma intelligence OÃœ_.<br/>
The application was inspired by the Estonian site [elektrikell.ee](https://www.elektrikell.ee/). APIs were also used, taken from the [Elering Live](https://dashboard.elering.ee/et) website. <br/>
This application will help you view the *price of electricity* in countries such as *Estonia, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia*.<br/>
You can also view *gas* prices in Finland and the current *gas* price in Estonia.<br/>
In my application, you can *select the period* you need to view prices and view it in the form of a* graph or table.*<br/>


## Such tools were used:
The app is written in the **JavaScript** programming language using the **react library**, as well as: <br/>
* React-bootstrap
* Redux
* Reacr-router
* SASS
